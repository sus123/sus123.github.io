<p>Among the prominent trends highlighted at Microsoft Inspire, our annual partner conference, was “digital optimism,” where the Microsoft cloud is playing an outsized role in many key areas defining the future of global business, including hybrid work, resilient global supply chains, inclusive economic development, global sustainability and cybersecurity. This optimism reflects how customers are increasingly seeking ways to innovate and future-proof their business models with the cloud. It also underscores how Microsoft and our global partner community are co-developing digital solutions that help these customers create lasting value amid pandemic-related market shifts, despite industry or geography.</p>
